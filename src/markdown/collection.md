⚠️ GraphQL APIs are all different from each other. Please make sure to refer to the documentation of the API you're using.

1. You must first enter the whole URL required to fetch this API endpoint.
2. Then, write the GraphQL query required to fetch the data you want.
3. Optionally, you can add variables and HTTP headers.

When you're done, click `next`!
